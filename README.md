## 🍃 Energy & Evolution: A story through data
This Tableau project explores the relationship between humanity’s evolution and energy use — from fire to renewables. Energy has always been more than a resource: it’s been the fuel behind every major leap in our history.

One striking example: in the late 19th century, cities like New York and London were overwhelmed by horse manure due to the rise of horse-drawn transport. The solution? The combustion engine — which, ironically, led us into a new crisis: fossil fuel dependency and climate change.

Today, we face a similar crossroad. Global energy demand keeps growing, but our focus has shifted toward sustainable sources. Yet, renewable energy brings its own challenges — like dependence on weather and the need for complex storage systems.

This project presents a data-driven narrative on the current state and global trends of renewable energy, focusing on solar and wind power. It visualizes:

- Global consumption shifts over time (e.g., the 2008 financial crisis, COVID-19).
- Renewable production by country and source.
- Capacity vs. real production in solar and wind.
- Surprising cases of small nations leading in renewables.
- The correlation between GDP per capita and renewable energy adoption (solar and wind).

## 🧭 Key questions we explore

- Which countries are leading in renewable energy, and why?
- Is higher GDP linked to a cleaner energy mix?
- How efficient is renewable capacity in real-world production?
- Can small nations be global role models in energy transition?

### 💡 Insights

- Countries like Spain and Denmark lead in wind efficiency.
- Some low-GDP countries (e.g. Morocco) show strong renewable adoption.
- Capacity doesn’t always equal production — e.g., Italy’s solar boom post-2008.
- The U.S. has high capacity but a low renewable electricity percentage due to scale.
- Political will and long-term vision appear more crucial than wealth alone.

> “There’s no single path to sustainability. While some invest in scale, others focus on smart use of resources. In the end, it’s a matter of priorities.”
